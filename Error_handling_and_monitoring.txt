To create an error handling and monitoring system we can use a combination of logging, monitoring tools, and alerting systems.
Below are the steps to set it up:

Logging:
Implement logging throughout the data pipeline to track the flow of data and record any errors or anomalies encountered.

Monitoring:
We can utilize monitoring tools like AWS CloudWatch to monitor key metrics and performance indicators of the data pipeline.

Alerting:
Configure alerting rules based on predefined thresholds or conditions for data quality metrics.

Error Handling:
We can implement robust error handling mechanisms at each stage of the data pipeline to catch and handle errors.

Data Quality Checks:
Define data quality checks and validation rules to ensure the integrity and consistency of the data.
Perform data quality checks during data ingestion, transformation, and loading stages.

I have implemented some of these setups in python in `Monitoring.py`. 
The python script uses python's logging module and the requests library for sending alerts to a Slack channel.

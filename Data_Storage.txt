We can use Amazon Redshift for data storage. It is a fully managed data warehousing service that offers high-performance querying 
and scalability for analytics workloads.

Redshift can optimize data for querying and aggregation in following ways:
- Columnar Storage: Amazon Redshift stores data in a columnar format, which improves query performance for analytical workloads. 
Columnar storage minimizes disk I/O by only reading the columns needed for a query, resulting in faster query execution.
- Compression: Amazon Redshift utilizes advanced compression techniques to reduce storage requirements and improve query performance. 
By compressing data at the column level, Redshift reduces disk I/O and enhances data retrieval speed.
- Data Partitioning: Redshift supports data partitioning, allowing us to partition tables based on specific criteria such as time or 
campaign ID. Partitioning can improve query performance by reducing the amount of data scanned for queries that filter on partition keys.
